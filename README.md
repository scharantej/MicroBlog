 # Python Flask Expert Assistant

## Problem Analysis
The problem at hand is to build a social network where users can post messages of up to 150 characters. To achieve this, we will design a Flask application with the necessary HTML files and routes.

## HTML Files
The following HTML files are required for our application:

- **index.html**: This will be the main page of our social network. It will display a form for users to post messages and a section to display the posted messages.
- **post.html**: This file will handle the form submission. It will validate the user input and save the message to the database.
- **messages.html**: This file will display the list of posted messages.

## Routes
The following routes are needed for our application:

- **"/"**: This route will render the index.html file.
- **"/post"**: This route will handle the POST request from the form in index.html. It will validate the user input and save the message to the database.
- **"/messages"**: This route will render the messages.html file, displaying the list of posted messages.

## Conclusion
This design provides a basic structure for a social network application using Python Flask. It includes the necessary HTML files and routes to handle user input and display messages. Further development and customization can be done based on specific requirements and preferences.
